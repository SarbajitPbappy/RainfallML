# ðŸŒ§ Bangladesh Rainfall and Temperature Analysis and Future Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing historical rainfall and temperature data for Bangladesh, identifying trends, and predicting future rainfall using machine learning techniques. The study aims to provide insights into weather patterns and potential future climate changes that could influence agriculture, disaster management, and resource planning.

## ðŸ›  Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: The core language used for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: Used for cleaning and organizing the rainfall and temperature data.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing trends in rainfall and temperature over time.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Utilized for building machine learning models to predict future rainfall trends.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The environment for running the code and performing the analysis.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Temperature (tem)**: Recorded temperature data over the years.
- **Month**: Represents the month for which the data is recorded.
- **Year**: The year in which the data was collected.
- **Rainfall (rain)**: The amount of rainfall measured in millimeters (or another standard unit).

This data covers several years, enabling the analysis of both short-term and long-term weather trends. The dataset has been cleaned and processed for machine learning applications.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- **Trend Analysis**: Analyzed historical data to identify patterns in rainfall and temperature.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualized rainfall and temperature trends through charts and graphs, helping to illustrate patterns over time.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed data for use in machine learning models.
- **Machine Learning Predictions**: Developed machine learning models to predict future rainfall based on historical data.

## ðŸ“Š Data Analysis and Prediction

### ðŸ”„ Data Processing

The dataset underwent extensive cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and standardize formats for analysis.

```python
# Sample data cleaning process
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('rainfall_data.csv')
data.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)
```
ðŸ“ˆ Trend Analysis
To understand the trend in rainfall and temperature, this project utilizes visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot these variables over time.
```
# Sample visualization for rainfall over the years
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(data['Year'], data['Rainfall'])
plt.title('Rainfall Trend Over Years')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Rainfall (mm)')
plt.show()
```
ðŸ¤– Machine Learning for Future Prediction
By using machine learning models like Linear Regression and Random Forest, the project predicts future rainfall based on historical data. The model accuracy and results were assessed using cross-validation and other evaluation metrics.
```
# Sample machine learning prediction using Linear Regression
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
X = data[['Year', 'Temperature']]
y = data['Rainfall']
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
predictions = model.predict([[2025, 29.5]])  # Example prediction for year 2025
```
ðŸ”‘ Key Findings
- **Seasonal Patterns:** Clear seasonal variation in rainfall, with certain months showing significantly higher averages.
- **Temperature Influence:** The analysis suggests a correlation between temperature changes and rainfall patterns.
- **Predictive Accuracy:** The machine learning models show promising accuracy in predicting future rainfall trends based on historical data.
ðŸŽ¯ **Conclusion and Future Directions**
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of rainfall and temperature trends in Bangladesh, and demonstrates the potential for predicting future rainfall using machine learning. Future work could include integrating more environmental factors, improving model accuracy, and applying deep learning techniques for more robust predictions.
